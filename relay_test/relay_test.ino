 * Compiled with Arduino 1.0.5
 * 
 * This is version 1.0
 * Status: TBD.
 *****************************************
 * v1.0 - Used to test the relay class.

 * Hardware Configuration:
 * Relay switch connected between pin D9 and Gnd. Uses 20kÎ© internal pullup.
 * Grove relay SIG connected to pin D10 and relay GND connected to Gnd. 
 * Operation:
