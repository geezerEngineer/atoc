Automatic Top-Off Controller

This controller is used to automate the addition of make-up water to a
16 gallon salt water aquarium. A float switch changes state when the
aquarium water level falls below a threshold level or when it rises
above a higher threshold level. The controller detects the state changes
and turns on and off a pump that transfers water from a fresh water
reservoir to the aquarium. 

The controller is an Arduino Uno R3.
